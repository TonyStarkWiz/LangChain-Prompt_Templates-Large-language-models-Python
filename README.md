# LangChain-Prompt_Templates-Large-language-models-Python
Led the development of the "LangChain Prompt Templates Large Language Models" Python project, utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo models for dynamic conversational interactions and content generation.

Implemented diverse prompts, including extracting facts about specific topics and generating vegan recipes, to assess the code's performance under varying input sizes.

Rigorously tested the code with inputs of different complexities, evaluating its response time and scalability. Employed systematic testing procedures to ensure consistent results.

Confirmed that the code exhibited constant runtime complexity (O(1)) regardless of input size, indicating optimal performance. The project achieved efficient and reliable interactions, validating its suitability for real-time conversational AI applications. - enjoy! ðŸ˜Ž
